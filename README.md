# Spaceship Game

This repository contains a very simple Asteroids-style game written in HTML5 and JavaScript. You can play it by opening `index.html` in your browser or hosting the repository with GitHub Pages.

Controls:
- **Arrow keys**: Rotate and thrust the ship
- **Space bar**: Shoot

Avoid the asteroids and try to survive as long as possible!

Asteroids appear immediately when the game starts. Each one is an irregular polygon moving in a random direction.
